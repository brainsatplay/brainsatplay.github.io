","Two connected players play a ping pong game inside their brains. After a hit, the hitting player becomes the ball and tries to land on the other player’s paddle. The goal of the game is for players to experience being part of a “well-played game”. Brainpong is inspired by an experience described by <a href=""https://www.deepfun.com/remembering-bill/"" class=""text"">Bernie DeKoven</a> that led him to writing “The Well-Played Game” book.

,,DARKROOM,Dimitris Grammenos,"In a bright future two generations from now, there is a conflict-free BBI game for up to eight players which is played for mental stimulation in a special room","A game for imagining together. During the game a mental experience develops, like a darkroom picture. The first player starts with something like a blurry, out of focus, image. This “image” may also include sounds, smells, sensations, feelings, etc. Someone else (when so moved) adds a detail, zooms in or out, adjusts focus, etc. Darkroom is an adaptation of a game included in Bernie DeKoven’s <a href=""https://www.deepfun.com/darkroom/"" class=""text"">Deep Fun</a>."
,,THOUGHT FOR FOOD,Dimitris Grammenos,"In a post-apocalyptic future a millennium from now, there is a semi-cooperative BBI game for a small group of players which is played for food in a cave.","In a future where the world is ruled by a technological Singularity, the few remaining humans live in remote caves under the surface of the earth. To get their food while avoiding the risk of being spotted by the Global Surveillance System, humans rely on predator animals that they control through brain implants. The game has two phases. On the coop phase, predators work together to catch prey and evade capture by the Singularity. When back to the safety of the cave, they try to outpower and outwit each other, to get the lion's share of the collected goods."
